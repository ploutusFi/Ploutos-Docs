# Disclaimer: Risks

**Please review our Disclaimer and Terms of Service before using the Gravita Protocol or interacting with GRAI. Gravita Protocol and GRAI are not available in the U.S.**

## 1. Description

Gravita Protocol is a novel, decentralized borrowing protocol that allows users to deposit assets and borrow the protocol’s native token, GRAI, against them. The Gravita Protocol protocol is made up of both proprietary and free, public, and open-source software. Your use of Gravita Protocol involves various risks, including, but not limited, to losses while digital assets are deposited into Gravita Protocol via smart contract or economic exploits, and losses due to liquidations and redemptions. Before borrowing, staking, or liquidity providing you should fully review our technical documentation to understand how the Gravita Protocol protocol works.

## 2. Audits

While the Gravita Protocol has been thoroughly audited by multiple independent software security firms and undergone third-party economic analysis, there remains a risk that assets deposited into the protocol as well as the GRAI and GRVT tokens may suffer complete and permanent economic loss should the protocol’s technical or economic mechanisms suffer catastrophic failure.

## 3. Use at your own risk

THE GRAVITA PROTOCOL IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. No developer or entity involved in creating the Gravita Protocol will be liable for any claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use, inability to use, or your interaction with other users of the Gravita Protocol protocol, including any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, or loss of profits, cryptocurrencies, tokens, or anything else of value. Gravita reserves the right to modify the terms of the Gravita protocol at any time for any reason.
