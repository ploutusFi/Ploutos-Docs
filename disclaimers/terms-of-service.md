## 2. Assumption of Risk

You assume the risks of engaging in transactions that rely on smart contracts and other experimental technology. Transactions on the Ploutos Protocol rely on smart contracts stored on the Ethereum blockchain blockchains, cryptographic tokens generated by the smart contracts, and other nascent software, applications and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks. These technologies are experimental, speculative, inherently risky, and subject to change. Among other risks, bugs, malfunctions, cyberattacks, or changes to the applicable blockchain (e.g., forks) could disrupt these technologies and even result in a total loss of cryptoassets, their market value, or digital funds. You are solely responsible for the safekeeping of the private key associated with the blockchain address used to interact with the Protocol. We assume no liability or responsibility for any such risks. If you are not comfortable assuming these risks, you should not access or engage in transactions using blockchain-based technology. One of the other defining features of blockchain technology is that its entries are immutable, which means, as a technical matter, they generally cannot be deleted or modified by anyone. This includes smart contracts and cryptoassets generated and programmed by smart contracts. THUS, TRANSACTIONS RECORDED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN, INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF CRYPTOASSETS AND DATA PROGRAMMED INTO THESE ASSETS MUST BE TREATED AS PERMANENT AND CANNOT BE UNDONE BY US OR BY ANYONE. YOU MUST BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU FINALIZE ANY TRANSACTION THAT WILL BE RECORDED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. We are not liable for any third-party services or links. We are not responsible for the content or services of any third-party, including, without limitation, any network, or apps like Discord, or MetaMask, and we make no representations regarding the content or accuracy of any third-party services or materials. The use and access of any third-party products or services, including through the Services, is at your own risk. You agree to the automated collection and disbursement of assets by smart contracts. You acknowledge and agree that all transactions accessed through the Services will be automatically processed using one or more blockchain-based smart contracts. By engaging in transactions using the Services, you acknowledge and consent to the automatic processing of all transactions in connection with using the Services. You further acknowledge and agree that the applicable smart contract will dictate how the funds of a transaction and ownership of cryptoassets are distributed. You acknowledge the risks of using the Services. You bear sole responsibility for evaluating the Services before using them, and all transactions accessed through the Services are irreversible, final, and without refunds. The Services may be disabled, disrupted or adversely impacted as a result of sophisticated cyber-attacks, surges in activity, computer viruses, and/or other operational or technical challenges, among other things. We disclaim any ongoing obligation to notify you of all of the potential risks of using and accessing our Services. You acknowledge there is a real risk that assets deposited into the protocol and Protocol related tokens, and vault tokens may suffer complete and permanent economic loss should the protocol’s technical or economic mechanisms suffer catastrophic failure. You acknowledge that the terms of the Protocol may change at any time for any reason included but not limited to protocol fees, rewards, and accessibility. You agree to (defined below) accept these risks and agree that you will not seek to hold any Ploutos Protocol Indemnified Party responsible for any consequent losses.
